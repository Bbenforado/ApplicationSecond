# True-Life
Personal project developped for the last OpenClassrooms project.  

True life is an app that allows people **to create projects**, and share them. It allows to create a **caring life** in a neighbourhood/city.  
There is two type of users: basic user and association.  
Users can check available projects in their city, apply to them and then, organize and realise them.  
Projects can be anything!  
Basic examples : "This day, this place, this time...  
* ...we are collecting clothes for homeless people
* ...we need english teachers for english class for refugees
* ...we will prepare and distribute food  
  
who is ready to help??"  

Each project has a chat where users can organize between themselves.

Associations users can publish more than projects, they can publish posts. A post is a quick information about the association, for example, they can post about their current needs and delete the post once the needs are not needed anymore.
