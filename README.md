# True-Life
Personal project developped for the last OpenClassrooms project.  

True life is an app that allows people **to create projects**, and share them. It allows to create a **caring life** in a neighbourhood/city.  
There is two type of users: basic user and association.  
Users can checks available projects in their city, apply to them and then, organize and realise them.  
Projects can be anything!  
Basic examples : "This day, this place, this time...  
* ...we are collecting clothes for homeless people
* ...we need english teachers for english class for refugees
* ...we will prepare and distribute food  
  
who is ready to help??"
